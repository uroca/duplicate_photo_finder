This is a personal project used to find duplicate photos.  It is a work in progress.

The program is initiated at dupe_photo_finder\dupePhotoFinder.py.

It accepts as an argument a folder or several folders to be searched for duplicate photos.

At the moment, it seeks particular photo extensions in the code:
.jpg, .nef (nikon raw photos) and .raf (fujifilm raw photos).
