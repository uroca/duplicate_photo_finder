Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" 
basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or 
statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the 
Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a 
particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the

Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort

special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of 
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any 
and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party 
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. Some 
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and 
limitation may not apply to You.
